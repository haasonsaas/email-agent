# Migration Scripts - DEPRECATED

⚠️ **These migration scripts are now deprecated.**

All functionality has been integrated into the main Email Agent CLI system:

## Instead of running migration scripts, use:

```bash
# CEO email setup and management
email-agent ceo setup           # Replaces: create_ceo_labels.py, setup_credentials.py
email-agent ceo label           # Replaces: apply_ceo_labels.py, bulk_label_emails.py
email-agent ceo analyze         # Replaces: analyze_ceo_emails.py, ceo_insights.py
email-agent ceo intelligence    # Replaces: fast_ceo_processor.py + advanced analysis

# Relationship and thread intelligence  
email-agent ceo relationships   # New: Advanced relationship analysis
email-agent ceo threads         # New: Thread continuity tracking

# Email pulling and processing
email-agent pull sync           # Replaces: pull_gmail_directly.py, pull_all_emails.py

# Testing and validation
email-agent status              # Replaces: test_install.py, check_email_count.py
```

## Migration Complete ✅

The intelligent CEO email management system is now fully integrated into the professional CLI interface. These scripts served their purpose during development but are no longer needed.

See the main README.md for integrated CEO intelligence features.
