# Advanced Email Agent Features - Implementation Guide

This document outlines the advanced features we're building on top of our working AI foundation.

## ðŸŒŸ Current AI Foundation (Working)

Our Email Agent already has:
- âœ… **OpenAI Integration**: gpt-4o-mini with 100% categorization accuracy
- âœ… **Multi-Agent System**: CrewAI orchestration working
- âœ… **Smart Categorization**: 7 category classification (primary, social, promotions, updates, forums, spam)
- âœ… **Email Summarization**: Context-aware summaries with action items
- âœ… **Daily Briefs**: Automated insight generation
- âœ… **CLI & TUI**: Full command-line and terminal interfaces

## ðŸš€ Next-Level Features to Implement

### 1. Intelligent Email Screening
**What it does:** Automatically identifies emails that need your attention vs. those that can be quietly archived.

**How it works:**
```python
# Example: Auto-triage pipeline
class EmailTriageAgent:
    async def screen_email(self, email: Email) -> TriageDecision:
        attention_score = await self.calculate_attention_score(email)
        if attention_score > 0.7:
            return TriageDecision.PRIORITY_INBOX
        elif attention_score > 0.3:
            return TriageDecision.REGULAR_INBOX
        else:
            return TriageDecision.AUTO_ARCHIVE
```

### 2. AI Draft Suggestions
**What it does:** Analyzes your writing style and drafts replies in your voice.

**Implementation approach:**
```python
class ReplyAgent:
    async def generate_draft(self, email: Email, user_profile: UserProfile) -> Draft:
        context = await self.analyze_conversation_context(email)
        style = await self.get_user_writing_style(user_profile)
        draft = await self.generate_response(context, style)
        return self.format_as_draft(draft)
```

### 3. Narrative Daily Briefs
**What it does:** Converts your email digest into a readable "story" under 60 seconds.

**Example output:**
> "Your Tuesday started with three priority items: Sarah from Finance needs the Q4 budget by Friday, the TechCrunch newsletter highlighted new AI developments you follow, and your dentist appointment was confirmed for next week. The rest of your inbox included routine updates from GitHub and LinkedIn that were quietly archived..."

### 4. Communication Habit Learning
**What it does:** Learns who you respond to quickly, what topics are important to you, and adapts accordingly.

**Learning pipeline:**
```python
class HabitLearner:
    def analyze_response_patterns(self, user_history: List[EmailInteraction]):
        # Track: response time by sender, topic importance, filing preferences
        # Build: priority weights, urgency indicators, preference models
        pass
    
    def update_priority_scoring(self, new_interaction: EmailInteraction):
        # Continuously improve email importance prediction
        pass
```

### 5. Conversational Interface
**What it does:** Natural language commands for email management.

**Example interactions:**
- "Always flag emails from billing@company.com as urgent"
- "Show me all emails about the Peterson project from last month"
- "That email about the meeting wasn't actually important, learn from this"
- "Draft a polite decline for this invitation"

### 6. Smart Auto-Archiving with Recovery
**What it does:** Automatically archives low-priority emails but makes them easily recoverable.

**Features:**
- Recovery tags: `#auto-archived`, `#newsletter`, `#notification`
- Quick commands: "Show me what was archived yesterday"
- Learning: Improves archiving decisions based on recovery patterns

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Features

### Topic Clustering
Groups related emails by project, client, or theme:
```
ðŸ“Š Project Alpha (5 emails)
â”œâ”€â”€ Design feedback from Sarah
â”œâ”€â”€ Budget approval from Finance  
â””â”€â”€ Timeline update from Dev team

ðŸ‘¥ Client: Peterson Corp (3 emails)
â”œâ”€â”€ Contract renewal discussion
â”œâ”€â”€ Meeting scheduling
â””â”€â”€ Product demo request
```

### Follow-up Reminders
Smart tracking of emails that need responses:
- "You usually respond to Sarah within 2 hours - it's been 6 hours"
- "This email about the deadline is getting old - follow up?"
- Auto-suggest follow-up timing based on content urgency

### Email Snoozing
Temporarily hide emails until you're ready:
- Smart suggestions: "This looks like a Monday morning task - snooze until Monday?"
- Calendar integration: "Snooze until after your 3 PM meeting"
- Recurring handling: "This weekly report - auto-snooze until Friday?"

### Thread & Attachment Analysis
Advanced content understanding:
- **Thread summaries**: "This 12-email thread resulted in approving the budget and scheduling a follow-up for next Tuesday"
- **Attachment insights**: "This PDF contains a contract with 3 action items for legal review"
- **Decision tracking**: "In this conversation, you agreed to handle the presentation while John takes the demo"

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Screening (Weeks 1-4)
Start with our working categorizer and add attention scoring:

1. **Extend the categorizer** to include attention scores
2. **Add auto-archiving logic** to the existing pipeline
3. **Create priority inbox views** in CLI and TUI
4. **Implement user feedback learning** for continuous improvement

### Phase 2: Draft Generation (Weeks 5-8)
Build on our summarizer agent:

1. **Analyze user's sent emails** to learn writing style
2. **Create reply templates** based on email context
3. **Generate contextual responses** using OpenAI
4. **Add draft management** to CLI commands

### Phase 3: Advanced Learning (Weeks 9-12)
Add sophisticated user modeling:

1. **Track user interactions** with emails
2. **Build communication pattern models**
3. **Implement adaptive priority scoring**
4. **Create preference learning algorithms**

### Phase 4: Conversational Interface (Weeks 13-16)
Natural language email management:

1. **Add chat interface** to TUI dashboard
2. **Implement command parsing** for natural language
3. **Create rule generation** from conversations
4. **Add query processing** for email search

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

To begin implementing these features on our existing foundation:

1. **Choose a starting feature** (recommend: Enhanced Screening)
2. **Extend existing agents** rather than starting from scratch
3. **Test incrementally** with our existing test suite
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** with current CLI/TUI

### Example: Adding Attention Scoring

```python
# In src/email_agent/agents/categorizer.py
async def calculate_attention_score(self, email: Email) -> float:
    """Calculate how much attention this email needs (0-1 scale)."""
    
    # Start with category-based baseline
    category_weights = {
        EmailCategory.PRIMARY: 0.8,
        EmailCategory.SOCIAL: 0.2,
        EmailCategory.PROMOTIONS: 0.1,
        # ... etc
    }
    
    base_score = category_weights.get(email.category, 0.5)
    
    # Adjust based on sender importance
    sender_score = await self.get_sender_importance(email.sender)
    
    # Adjust based on content urgency
    urgency_score = await self.detect_urgency_indicators(email)
    
    # Combine scores with learned weights
    final_score = (base_score * 0.4 + sender_score * 0.3 + urgency_score * 0.3)
    
    return min(1.0, max(0.0, final_score))
```

This builds directly on our working AI categorization system and gradually adds the advanced intelligence features you described.

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

For each feature, we'll track:
- **Accuracy**: How often the AI makes the right decision
- **Time Saved**: Measurable reduction in email processing time  
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on automated decisions
- **Learning Rate**: How quickly the system adapts to user preferences

The goal is to create an email agent that truly understands your communication patterns and handles routine email management automatically while keeping you in control of important decisions.
